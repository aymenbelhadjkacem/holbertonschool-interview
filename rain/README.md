# rain

This project contains solutions for the Rain problem, which involves calculating the amount of water retained after it rains.

## Description

The rain problem involves given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls, calculating how many square units of water will be retained after it rains. The solution provided here implements an algorithm that iterates through the list of walls and calculates the amount of water retained between each pair of walls.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- No importing of modules is allowed
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All files must be executable

## Files
